# palgiarism-checker
This project focuses on text preprocessing and plagiarism detection using various techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) and the Rabin-Karp algorithm. Below is an overview of the project's main components and functionality.
1. Text Preprocessing
2. Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Plagiarism Detection
The Rabin-Karp algorithm is used to detect plagiarism by finding matching substrings between two texts. It uses rolling hash techniques to efficiently search for patterns.

 Plagiarism Detection
The kgram function compares two preprocessed texts by calculating the similarity of their k-grams.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to text preprocessing and plagiarism detection, offering insights into sentence matching and substring (k-gram) matching techniques.
